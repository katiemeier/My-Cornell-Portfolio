# My-Cornell-Portfolio
A portfolio of my work from the Break Through Tech machine learning foundations cost through Cornell University. This features Jupyter Notebooks including 
each step of the machine learning process, such as data preparation, training your model, and selecting your model. The notebooks were created by Cornell faculty,
and I inputted code snippets.

In these notebooks, code is written in Python, and the libraries of NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, MatPlotLib, and Seaborn are utilized. Beyond the code that I was asked to write,
in some of the notebooks I added additional cells, marked by #test cell, to demonstrate where I added my own code. The purpose of these cells was to test additional 
hyperparameters, and to create custom visualizations to demonstrate the hyperparameter values vs. the model performance.
