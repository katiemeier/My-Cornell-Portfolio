        "Jupyter notebooks are an alternative environment for developing and running code, as well as for integrating  documentation and graphical results.  The IPython interpreter is running inside a Jupyter notebook, and can process both Python code and IPython <code>%magic</code> functions that you enter into the input cells.  Jupyter notebooks introduce a new level of code structure, that of cells, and the IPython interpreter is running within each of those code cells.  You can group multiple Python expressions together in a cell, and those expressions only get evaluated once you execute the entire cell.  In Jupyter notebooks, a simple carriage return (<code>return</code> key on keyboard) will move you down to a new line in the same cell, but in order to <i>execute the cell</i>, you must type <code>Shift+Return</code>, i.e., the Shift and Return keys at the same time.  You can also execute the currently active cell by clicking on the `>| Run` button at the top of the page. Do not use the `Validate` button; this does not execute a cell. For a quick tour of the interface, click the <code>Help</code> tab in the menu above and find <code>User Interface Tour</code> at the top.\n",
